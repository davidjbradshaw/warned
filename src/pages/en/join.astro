      <h3>Why Join Us?</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        We are an international collective of multidisciplinary staff, volunteers, artists, performers and instructors of all ages who come from diverse backgrounds. While some have met through "Burner" events - artistic events that share the principles and values ​​of the U.S. Burning Man festival i.e. open-mindedness, self-expression, giving, sharing, respect for others and their environment, autonomy - some hail from the entrepreneurial or corporate universe, some from the field of entertainment sphere, and others from the medical and caring professions.

      <p class="highlight">
        <strong>What do they have in common?</strong> The desire to help reactivate GOLDIES socially, professionally and emotionally.

        Based primarily in Brussels and Amsterdam, our collective overflows with energy to engage our community of GOLDIES and celebrate the third act with confidence and pride. Everything is inspired and designed to awaken the FLAMINGOLD that lies dormant in all of us, young or old. In the spirit of collaboration, and co-creation, we are consistently seeking to expand our driving force - that is YOU!
