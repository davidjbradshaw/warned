      <p>
        In the current situation, we rely primarily on financial donations to keep our doors open and to produce our events and activities. As the GOLDIES community continues to grow, our original initiatives require additional sources of funding, as do the maintenance of our space in Uccle and our operating costs. Your donation of just a few euros helps us sustain and expand our mission to inspire the GOLDIES, improve lives, and foster a society that better integrates all generations. Every contribution, no matter how small, can make a big difference.

    <h2>What Your Donation Can Do</h2>

        <h3>Inclusivity / Our Tea Dance Events</h3>
        <p>Our Tea Dance events are designed to be accessible: by keeping ticket prices affordable, below the true value of the experience, we deliberately choose inclusion. Your donations make it possible to fairly compensate the artists, musicians, and volunteers who bring these festive moments to life, while offering the GOLDIES a rich and complete experience.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="impact-card">
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>Beyond our events, your donations contribute to the day-to-day operation of WARNED and make all of our actions possible. In a spirit of solidarity, they support our mission of social, emotional, and professional activation of the GOLDIES, and enable us to maintain inclusive, innovative, and accessible activities for everyone.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="impact-card">
        <h3>Transmission</h3>
        <p>Behind every Thé au Jardin workshop, there are women and men who share their knowledge, energy, and commitment. Your donations allow us to recognise and value the time, dedication, and expertise of the numerous facilitators who offer the GOLDIES a moment out of time — to discover, learn, experiment, laugh, and connect.</p>

      <h2>Pay What You Can</h2>
      <p>
        At the Garden, most of our activities operate on a pay-what-you-can basis. This choice is no coincidence: for us, it is the fairest and most respectful way to bring inclusion to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pay-what-you-can allows everyone to contribute according to their means and the value they place on what they receive. It is built on trust, autonomy, responsibility, and solidarity—values that lie at the very heart of the Garden and of WARNED.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are particularly committed to this model because it respects the autonomy of the GOLDIES, who know better than anyone what things are worth and what they can afford. Here, no one has to justify themselves, ask for a reduced rate, or explain their situation: everyone takes part in their own way, with full dignity.
      </p>
      <p>
        When those who can contribute help support those who can contribute less, access to our activities remains open to all. It is a beautiful demonstration that solidarity works—and that together, we truly make a difference.
