      <p>
        WARNED - <strong>We Are Retired Not ExpireD</strong> - is a non-profit which dedicates itself to the creation of unique initiatives, events and activities that activate the senior community. We aim to revolutionize the world of seniors by actively fighting ageism and highlighting the positive role played by retirees within society. We help seniors - <strong>GOLDIES</strong> - to pursue more active and fulfilling social lives, and have fun! We promote intergenerational relationships and social cohesion. We add value through the sharing and transfer of professional skills. We encourage seniors to celebrate their age with confidence and pride.

        <div class="pillar-card">
          <h3>Social Connection</h3>
          <p>Thé Dansant emphasizes social connection between GOLDIES and their community via friendship and personal relationships. By providing a supportive, safe and fun environment, we encourage intergenerational mixing, peer-to-peer relationships and active participation.</p>

        <div class="pillar-card">
          <h3>Emotional Wellbeing</h3>
          <p>At the heart of our initiative is the belief that all GOLDIES should have the space to develop self confidence, to boost self esteem, and to improve mood which all carry forward into their daily lives. We make it a priority to offer emotional support to grow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pillar-card">
          <h3>Professional Power</h3>
          <p>Initiatives celebrate the deep professional experience that all our GOLDIES have to offer, no matter their field of expertise. We recognize the enduring vitality of a senior workforce by creating projects that aid professional connection and knowledge sharing.</p>

      <h2>About GOLDIES</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>GOLDIES</strong> - the community of seniors 65+ - are the beating heart of WARNED. Regardless of marital status, gender, sexuality, race, politics, religion, economic background or profession, all GOLDIES are welcome to participate in the unique events, activities and initiatives that WARNED creates.
      </p>
      <p>
        At WARNED, we aim to release the <strong>FLAMINGOLD</strong> in all our GOLDIES. Perfectly embodying the spirit of the GOLDIE, the pink flamingo represents the mastery of emotions, cooperation, openness and love, while being charming, graceful and serene. It traditionally symbolizes one's social nature and the desire to create community bonds in which we can all thrive.
