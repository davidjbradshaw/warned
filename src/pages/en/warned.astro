        <h2>Why WARNED</h2>

        <p>
          The city accentuates the feeling of isolation: meeting places are disappearing, neighborhood relations are weakening and ageism is insidiously taking hold in the organization of society. Older people are particularly vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation - especially in cities - and this can have serious consequences for their health. Studies suggest that loneliness could increase the risk of premature death by a quarter or more and be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. It is the responsibility of all of us to encourage intergenerational connection and to lift the elderly out of loneliness.
        </p>

        <p>
          A new phenomenon is here: more time is available to today's generation of seniors. Life has lengthened to such an extent that we face twenty, thirty, even forty years of life beyond retirement. What to do with this gift? What projects can we envisage that prove suitable, fruitful, realistic and inventive? How can a positive "aging culture" emerge that both provides seniors with better living conditions and also gives meaning to what they experience? We have to be intelligent and creative in order to tackle "sustainable aging" head-on. This is where WARNED comes in.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>WARNED - We Are Retired Not ExpireD</strong> - is a non-profit which dedicates itself to the creation of unique initiatives, events and activities that activate the senior community. We aim to revolutionize the world of seniors by actively fighting ageism and highlighting the positive role played by retirees within society. We help seniors - <strong>GOLDIES</strong> - to pursue more active and fulfilling social lives, and have fun! We promote intergenerational relationships and social cohesion. We add value through the sharing and transfer of professional skills. We encourage seniors to celebrate their age with confidence and pride.

          </div>
          <h3>Social Connection</h3>
          <p>
            Our <strong>Thé Dansant</strong> and <strong>Jardin</strong> activities emphasize social connection between GOLDIES and their community via friendship and personal relationships. By providing a supportive, safe and fun environment, we encourage intergenerational mixing, peer-to-peer relationships and active participation.

          <h3>Emotional Wellbeing</h3>
          <p>
            At the heart of our <strong>Third Date</strong> initiative is the belief that all GOLDIES should have the space to develop self confidence, to boost self esteem, and to improve mood which all carry forward into their daily lives. We make it a priority to offer emotional support to grow.

          </div>
          <h3>Professional Power</h3>
          <p>
            Our <strong>Third Act</strong> initiatives celebrate the deep professional experience that all our GOLDIES have to offer, no matter their field of expertise. We recognize the enduring vitality of a senior workforce by creating projects that aid professional connection and knowledge sharing.

          <p>
            <strong>GOLDIES</strong> - the community of seniors 65+ - are the beating heart of WARNED. Regardless of marital status, gender, sexuality, race, politics, religion, economic background or profession, all GOLDIES are welcome to participate in the unique events, activities and initiatives that WARNED creates.
          </p>

          <p>
            At WARNED, we aim to release the <strong>FLAMINGOLD</strong> in all our GOLDIES. Perfectly embodying the spirit of the GOLDIE, the pink flamingo represents the mastery of emotions, cooperation, openness and love, while being charming, graceful and serene. It traditionally symbolizes one's social nature and the desire to create community bonds in which we can all trust.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most importantly, the flamingo represents the late blossoming of beauty and confidence. Born grey and pale, it takes on its distinctive colour with age - just as our GOLDIES are encouraged to flourish with pride during their senior years.
